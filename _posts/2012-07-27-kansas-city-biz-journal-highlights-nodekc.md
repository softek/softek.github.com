[NodeKC](http://nodekc.org) (Kansas City's Node.js user group) was formed in early 2012 by Softek developers [Joe](/profiles/joseph.andaverde.html), [Dusty](/profiles/dusty.burwell.html), [Andrew](/profiles/andrew.dunkman.html), and [Scott](/profiles/scott.smerchek.html) to focus on getting Kansas City developers excited about [Node.js](http://nodejs.org).

The Kansas City Business Journal published an article today highlighting the group:

> If you use it for work and still want to experiment with it when you get home, it's probably worthy of group discussion.

> That's the conclusion Andrew Dunkman came to earlier this year when he helped form NodeKC, a monthly gathering focused on Node.js, a software system that the group's members use for fun projects at home -- and increasingly for projects at work.
